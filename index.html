          <br>
          <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">House waste management refers to the systematic handling, collection, disposal, and recycling of waste generated in households. It involves practices aimed at reducing the amount of waste produced, reusing materials where possible, and recycling items to minimize the impact on the environment.</p>

          <div class="destination-item">
            <h3>Waste Segregation</h3>
            <p>
              This involves separating household waste into different categories such as organic, recyclable, and non-recyclable materials. Proper segregation makes it easier to recycle and dispose of waste appropriately.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="destination-item">
            <h3>Composting</h3>
            <p>
              Composting is the process of turning organic waste like food scraps, yard trimmings, and paper into compost. This nutrient-rich material can be used to improve soil quality in gardens and reduce the amount of organic waste sent to landfills.

            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="destination-item">
            <h3>Recycling</h3>
            <p>
              Recycling involves collecting and processing materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal so they can be reused in the manufacturing of new products. Participating in recycling programs helps reduce the volume of waste sent to landfills and conserves natural resources.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="destination-item">
            <h3>Waste Reduction</h3>
            <p>
              Waste reduction strategies focus on minimizing the amount of waste generated in the first place. This can include purchasing products with minimal packaging, using reusable items instead of single-use ones, and avoiding disposable products whenever possible.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="destination-item">
            <h3>Safe Disposal</h3>
            <p>
              Proper disposal of non-recyclable and hazardous waste is essential to protect the environment and public health. This involves following local regulations and guidelines for disposing of waste that cannot be recycled or composted safely.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="destination-item">
            <h3>Household Hazardous Waste Management</h3>
            <p>
              This involves handling and disposing of hazardous waste materials such as batteries, paint, cleaning products, and electronic waste (e-waste) in a manner that minimizes environmental impact and human health risks.
